      I'm Jonathan Lundquist, I defended my Ph.D. dissertation at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in Sept 2024.  My research focus is microwave engineering with a particular specialization in reconfigurable and flexible antennas.  Prior to attending college I was in the U.S. Navy's nuclear program and later worked in commercial calibrations at CATLab Accredited Calibrations Laboratories (now owned by TresCal).  Owing to this diverse background on top of my speciailiztions in microwave engineering I also have experience in industrial mechanical trades (Valve repair, air systems, pump repair, valve/pump repacking, steam plant operations), quality assurance programs (ISO 9001, ISO 17025, ANSI Z540), test equipment calibrations, uncertainty analysis, and test equipment programming and interfacing in C#, Python, MATLAB, C and C++.

      I also have experience with GUI development in C++ with Qt4 and 5, Microsoft Visual C# and MATLAB GUIDE and MATLAB's App Framework.  I am an avid Linux user and have been using Linux as my daily driver on my home computer for decades (That being said, Microsoft Edge is my favorite browser on Linux: Fight me!). My preferences is RPM based distributions, but I'm comfortable with just about anything.  Also, while not my prefered OS I am comfortable with Microsoft Windows, and other MS products, including MS Office.
      <br><br>
      I received my BSEE from VCU in 2020, with a 4.0 GPA.  During my time at VCU in undergrad I was chair of the IEEE student branch at VCU, a member of the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition Team (2nd place at MACCDC Regionals 2019), and member of the Linux User's Group (LUG).
